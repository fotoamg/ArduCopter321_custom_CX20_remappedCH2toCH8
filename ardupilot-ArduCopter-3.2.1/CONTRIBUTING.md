# How to contribute to the APM project?

If you are reading this page, you are possibly interested in contributing to our project.  We have a very active (and friendly) developer group and would love to have the help!  Possible ways you can help:

* Testing the code
* Filing issues on github, when you see a problem (or adding detail to existing issues that effect you)
* Fixing issues
* Adding new features
* Reviewing existing pull requests, and notifying the maintainer if it passes your code review.

# How to make a good bug report...

# Development Team

The ArduPilot project is open source and [maintained](MAINTAINERS.md) by a team of volunteers.

To contribute, you can send a pull request on Github. You can also
join the [development discussion on Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/drones-discuss). Note
that the Google Groups mailing lists are NOT for user tech support,
and are moderated for new users to prevent off-topic discussion.
